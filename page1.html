				<p>My parents have always been my greatest source of education in life, but there have been two other sources that have really aided 
				me in taking off of the launch pad. The first source was my general eduation in grade school and the other was when I began to learn 
				about philosophy.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For 11 years from kindergarten through 10th grade I attended the The New Testament Christian School (TNTCS) in Plymouth, Massachusetts. 
				This private school was non-denominational and affilated with the church that was attached to it. Most of the students attended that church
				while me and my siblings remained for a long time the only Christians of the Nazarene denomination who attended it. The influences in the school were namely 
				Baptist, Catholic, and Puritan. TNTCS definitely molded me into the person I am today. I did not really fit in with the 
				other students here and I was viewed like an outsider on many occasions, but I did learn a significant amount about the fundamentals of the Christian faith
				and what it means to follow and trust Christ with your life from a Biblical principles approach. The school was also very patriotic and 
				there was a zeal for the founding fathers and the foundational work they did to establish this country in making it the most well-governed
				entity without compromising on their founding principles, namely the preservation of inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit 
				of happiness. They understood that their nation had been founded on Biblical principles, and it is in this sense that I am most proud to 
				be called a TNTCS Knight.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For the remainder of my grade school years I attended Plymouth South High School. Coming into public school for the first 
				time and after everyone pretty much knew everyone else from 9th grade on (if not earlier) left me pretty lonely once again without any 
				social skills (which I didn't recognize at the time as being of any value), but this didn't last very long once 
				I invested myself into the culture of the school, particularly into learning. I had the opportunity to broaden my horizons and I learned 
				many things, much more than I had been learning previously. I was much happier there and glad I decided to switch. I fit in well with the school's culture of misfits 
				and it optimistic, post-modern spirit. Little did I know that my decision to switch schools would ultimately impact my choice as to 
				where I would complete my undergraduate studies (due to a certain Mr. Coon who encouraged me to pursue my aspirations). 
				That decision changed my entire life everafterward.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Today I chip away at the block of education at Trevecca Nazarene University. Trevcca has offered me many great 
				opportunities, specifically in athleticism with running. Trevecca, however, surely did not come without drawbacks which at times were 
				personally difficult to navigate. There were many great teachers and many sub-par 
				teachers at Trevecca (the same can be said for its students) - though it really only takes one teacher in particular to impact your
				perspective more than any other and in a way that will never leave you the same. This character is Steve Hoskins and he is the person who introduced 
				me quite well to the subject of philosophy, specifically how to use it as a tool guide for life. Ever since then my worldview has been 
				altered quite drastically through careful and thorough speculation on extremely relevant and acccurate 
				questions, though quite deep and requiring a large amount of effort and 
				focus at times. There did not occur speculation without application, and this with just as much care was carried out by myself as well. 
				It would be a nightmare to try and go into any significant depth on the subject here, but I will say that I strive continually 
				after wisdom nowadays with open eyes that need to be improved evermore. In a more theological sense as I have come to see the dangers of trusting ones own judgement with 
				the most important things at times.</p>
