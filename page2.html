					I grew up more with my om's side of the family and less with my dad's family due to them living far away. My grandfather on my mother's side, 
					who I take after the most, is the only living grandparent I still have alive. I see my extended family a lot less now since I decided to 
					go to school out-of-state which would bring my family ultimately to follow me to the Nashville area.
				</p>
				<br>

					I have quite a few relatives who are quite scientifically-minded. One of my grandfathers was a chemist, the other was a sewing 
					machine manager, my dad is an information technology project manager, my aunt and uncle are both
					physician assistants, I have a cousin who is a bio-chemist, her sister is going to school to be a nurse, and I have another uncle who
					is in the computer science field and his son is going into graphic design. It is cool to see the variety in occupation within such a 
					close group of people.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					All-in-all I have a lot of family. My mom has a brother and a sister and my dad has one sister and four brothers. Almost all have kids. 
					On my dad's side of the family because he is so young my cousins are the age that a typical uncle or aunt would be and I am the same 
					age as my second counsins.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Family is the first line of defense and support. It really shows when the tough days come that family matters more than 
					anything in the world. I am glad to have so much in common with them all, I wouldn't wish for any other family than mine.
