				<p>
					Hi! My name is Collyn Brenner. To put it briefly I am a 23-year-old believer in work being a requirement for the best future
					possible - this particularly for both individuals and the collective whole of humanity in the context of nature itself. I believe
					in the redemptive and restorative power of love. My hope is in the Triune God over any other power on earth.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I was born in Massachusetts in the city of Weymouth and grew up in a town that is an hour south of Boston called Plymouth. I was
					raised in a Christian household in the Nazarene denomination with parents and extended family that are rationally, personally, and
					scientifically oriented. I attended a private, non-denominational Christian school for 11 years before I began to branch out and
					discover new heights.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					I was a very curious and quiet kid growing up. I am a bit louder now but still just as curious. I have always been a deep thinker.
					More recently I have come to be a more holistic thinker
					and observer as well. I have always had a God-given talent and interest in figuring out how things work and interact. My biggest
					deficiency growing up had always been my social skills and lack of desire for personal interaction that I believe is due in large
					part to the perspective and approach that I adopted from my family on how to handle personal matters and problems but also just as
					much due to my introversion-leaning personality.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					I am currently enrolled at
					Trevecca Nazarene University in a non-traditional, online Computer Information Technology program. I am a musician and songwriter by hobby and
					I have a big interest in the design and interactions of man. My wife is Katie Brenner and she is my biggest supporter and motivator
					to do and be better in all areas of my life. I am a very curious individual at heart and I love to learn about any and everything that I
					find curiously exceptional because I want to understand why it is that way and to know how I might achieve similar excellence in whatever I do.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Today I use my talents, skills and education to apply philosophical ideas to observations, scenarios and questions in light of morality in various areas of life
					in pursuit of learning how to bring about the greatest amount of everlasting good possible with my life. I intend to capitalize on
					opportunities presented to me in achieving this goal in whatever form it ends up manifesting itself as I continually discover it as
					my passion.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I believe that each person's life is ultimately guided by what they believe and by what they hold as important. This can also be described as 
					a person's values, which typically become intrinsic motivators for that person (intrinsic motivation is the most powerful form of motivation). I value time, philosophy/wisdom,
					salvation from condemnation, the nuclear family, God's words, efficiency, sufficient and perpetual solutions,
					smart work, hard work, holistic education, meaningful relationships, professionalism, using a principles approach when imperative, effective communication,
					honesty, authenticity, creativity, health (spiritual, physical, and mental), democracy, conservation of energy and resources, understanding of the
					pitfalls and shortcomings of man due
					to his own nature, and life in every diverse instance it is discovered (to name a few).
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I absolutely hate broken relationships and everything that
					causes destruction of meaningful relationships, namely sin. I do not like leaving things on bad terms and I dislike not finishing something
					that I have started.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					This website will provide you with a synopsis of who I am, what drives me, who I hold close, what interests me, what I consider
					to be some of my most impactful life influences, and what I eventually wish to do in the unstoppable future. Enjoy!
