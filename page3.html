				<p>
					I would consider myself to be a fairly talented individual, although I probably wouldn't have considered it as such if no one had 
					told me so. I've had my ways with distance running, competitive swimming, speed stacks, Rubik's cubes, origami, music, singing, 
					and songwriting. Having talent turns out to not mean much if you don't apply it and develop the skill further. It is good at 
					getting you a good distance down the road at the start but hard work is what gets you there.
				</p>

					Of all of my successes I think my biggest success was marrying my lovely wife, Katie. She loves me with a 
					compassionate heart and person-first attitude that constantly makes me want to do and be better for her and for others. She leads 
					me on to embody Christ more and more each day and is the kind of motivation that I needed in areas where I am weakest. She is beauty 
					and I have yet to value her enough for all that she has brought to my life to this point and for years yet to come.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Some of my other success include graduating high school, becoming a scoring member of the TNU Cross Country team, getting top 10 as 
					a Bible quizzer in the New England district for the Nazarene church, and that one time my friend Archie spiked my hair - that was quite 
					a success (and I want to bring it back at least one more time). One of my biggest musical successes was the release of my first album 
					'Unexpected Upsides'. One of the songs on the album, <em>'Catch The Pieces'</em> is sampled to the right for your viewing pleasure if 
					you'd like to take a listen.
