# profile_me_ccb_rwd

Name: Profile Me CCB (profilemeccb.netlify.app)

Description:
This website is designed and built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JS. It utilizes Responsive Web Design (RWD). It started as a course project that ultimately was not finished, so I took it upon myself to finish it so as to gain the experience and learning in RWD that I desired to have. It is hosted from static files on Netlify using GitHub. The content serves the purpose of introducing myself to those who do not know me so that they can get a grasp of what I am about, particularly those things that may not be available to learn on the surface and which people may not know what to ask about. 

Badges: none

Visuals: none

Installation: no ecosystem/framework; static files with static hosting

Usage: link: profilemeccb.netlify.app

Support:
For help/suport please send an email to collynbrenner@gmail.com and I will get back to you soon. Please provide ample detail as to the subject matter you are presenting as it will be very much appreciated and save both you and I some time.

Roadmap: This was built as an exercise. It has achieved its intended purpose and will not be expanded save for updating the content of the site itself from time to time.

Contributing:
